This repository should help enrich your c# application.
Currently it contains two interesting libraries, the DependencyInjectionExtensions and the Decorators.
DependencyInjectionExtensions extends the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions with usefull things.
Decorators is a collection of generic decorators for an aspect.
They both actually work very well together.
